What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture which promotes collaboration between Development and Operations Team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way. The word 'DevOps' is a combination of two words 'development' and 'operations.'

DevOps helps to increase an organization's speed to deliver applications and services. It allows organizations to serve their customers better and compete more strongly in the market.

In simple words, DevOps can be defined as an alignment of development and IT operations with better communication and collaboration.


Why Devops is needed?

1) Before DevOps, the development and operation team worked in complete isolation.

2)Testing and Deployment were isolated activities done after design-build. Hence they consumed more time than actual build cycles.

3)Without using DevOps, team members are spending a large amount of their time in testing, deploying, and designing instead of building the project.

4)Manual code deployment leads to human errors in production

5)Coding & operation teams have their separate timelines and are not in synch causing further delays.

6)There is a demand to increase the rate of software delivery by business stakeholders. As per Forrester Consulting Study, Only 17% of teams can use delivery software fast enough. This proves the pain point.


Code Repository

A source-code repository is a file archive and web hosting facility where a large amount of source code, for software or for web pages, is kept, either publicly or privately. They are often used by open-source software projects and other multi-developer projects to handle various versions.
